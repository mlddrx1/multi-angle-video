# Multi-Angle Video – Parking Lot / TODO

## UX / Flow (To Revisit)

- [ ] Consider replacing separate "Play All" / "Pause All" buttons with a single toggle
- [ ] Add pause-aware status messaging (advance to Step 2 after Pause All)
- [ ] Optional Tier 2 Help panel (opt-in, non-intrusive)

## Sync & Playback

- [ ] Decide whether unmarked cameras should visually indicate "not synced"
- [ ] Confirm behavior when videos have significantly different durations
- [ ] Evaluate drift over longer playback (real phone footage)

## Controls & Ergonomics

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Space = Play/Pause All, etc.)
- [ ] Fine-tune nudge step size (0.1s vs configurable)

## Future / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Save/load multiple sync presets
- [ ] Clip switching after sync
- [ ] Export synced clips
